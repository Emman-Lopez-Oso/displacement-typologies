# Displacement Typologies 
 
## Overview
 
This repository holds all the code needed to produce the [UDP Displacement Typology maps](https://urbandisplacement.org) visualizing neighborhood change in several US regions. We provide this code so that you may be able to replicate this work in your own state/city.
 
*Any modified code that is taken from this repo and not reviewed by the Urban Displacement Project is not endorsed by us and should be documented accordingly as not endorsed by the Urban Displacement Project.*
 
## Code & Usage
 
To run the code, fork this repository and navigate to the `code/README.md` file and follow the instructions. You will have to edit the files to include your state and city accordingly. Once completed, follow the instructions in the readme to download all external datasets for your specific region that will be required, then run the five consecutive files of code in a terminal window, as indicated in the readme replacing your state/city name.
